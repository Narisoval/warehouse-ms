# Warehouse Microservice üè≠
This microservice is designed to provide easy access to product information stored in the warehouse through an intuitive API. Its main features include:

1. üì¶ **Data Storage:** The microservice stores all product information, including descriptions, images, and other characteristics.
2. üîç **Querying:** Users can query the microservice to retrieve information about specific products, such as their name, description, and image.
3. ‚úèÔ∏è **Editing:** The API allows users to edit existing product information or add new products to the database.
4. üí™ **Robustness:** The microservice is designed to be robust and scalable, ensuring that it can handle large volumes of requests without any issues.
 
Overall, the goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use API for managing all aspects of product information in the warehouse.

# API endpoints

## Versioning
The API supports versioning to ensure backward compatibility and to allow the introduction of 
new features without impacting existing clients. In this application, the API versioning strategy uses the 
URL segment method for specifying the desired API version.

To specify the API version in the URL, add a segment containing the version number after the base URL. 
The version number should be prefixed with v. 

For example:

```http request
GET https://example.com/api/v1/brands/all
```
